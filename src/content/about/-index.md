I’m Tina Bloom, a **sleep consultant passionate about improving lives through better sleep**. For over a decade, I’ve been dedicated to helping people build healthier sleep habits, enhance their nighttime routines, and optimize daily rhythms for peak performance and wellness.

At **The Sleep Habits**, my mission is simple: make quality sleep accessible to everyone through clear, practical advice backed by science.

When I’m not consulting on sleep strategies, I enjoy exploring mindfulness practices, testing the latest wellness trends, and winding down with a good book and a calming herbal tea.
